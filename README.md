# Treasure-Hunt
Clojure implementation of Maze solving game. 

Being an	intrepid explorer, you are searching	for	buried	treasure through	a	series	of very	dark	tunnels. You	have	no	light	and	no	signs	to	guide	your	way.	All	you	can	do	is	blindly	feel	around	and	wander	through	the	tunnels	until	you	hopefully	enter	the	room	that	contains	the	treasure.	You	can, however,	leave	a	trail	of	breadcrumbs	behind	you so	that	if	you	
come	to	the	end	of	a	tunnel	and	you	canâ€™t	go	any	further,	you	can	get	back	to	where	you	were	and	
try	again	in	another	direction.
